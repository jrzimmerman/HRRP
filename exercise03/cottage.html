      dense plantings, and a mixture of ornimental and edible plants. </p>

    <div class="middle">
      <p> The cottage garden originated in <span><u>England</u></span> and its history can be traced
        back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized
        versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously
        maintained <span><u>English estate gardens</u></span>.
    </div>
    <div class="end">
      <p> The earlier cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,
        with and emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
